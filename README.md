UpWhats is a Python-based interactive chat system that simulates the functionality of a chat app, allowing users to send and receive messages, delete messages, and mark messages as starred.

Features
User authentication: only members of the conversation are allowed to send and read messages.
Message sending: users can send messages, and the system checks if there is enough space in the conversation for the new message.
Message deletion: users can delete an existing message by specifying its ID.
Star marking: users can mark a message as starred by specifying its ID.
Starred messages listing: users can view a list of all starred messages.
Internal check: the system provides statistics about the messages exchanged in the conversation, including the number of messages that contain all the letters of the alphabet and the most common letter.
